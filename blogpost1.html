    <p>As this is my first blog I would love to write about my bestie. 
        Life is a journey that is full of ups and downs.
         It's not always easy, but it's important to make the most of every moment. 
         I have been blessed to have a best friend who has taught me many valuable lessons about living life to the fullest.
         She is someone who has always been there for me, even during my darkest times.
         In this blog post, I want to share some of the lessons that I have learned from her.
    </p>
         <h5>Lesson 1: Dream big</h5>
    <p>
        Laiba is someone who is always scared of her future she have big dreams but dont know what her future is going to bring her.
         Whether it's painting,making new kinds of things, or the dream of her to go for hiking together someday, she is a big dreamer and I love that about her.
         Through her example, I have learned that life is too short to ignore those little things, I know living a practical life is better but where is the fun in that.
         So my advise will be to never stop dreaming and making them real.
    </p>
    <p>  
    <h5> Lesson 2: Live in the Present</h5>
        Another valuable lesson that I have learned from my Laiba is the importance of living in the present.
         She is someone who is always fully present in the moment, whether it's enjoying a cup of coffee(even though she dosn't really like coffee) or going for a walk.
         Through her example, I have learned that we should savor each moment and not worry too much about the future.
    </p>   
      <h5>  Lesson 3: Cherish Your Relationships</h5>
    <p>Laiba is someone who cherishes her relationships.
         She is always there for her loved ones, even during difficult times.
         Through her example, I have learned that relationships are one of the most important things in life.
         We should all make an effort to nurture our relationships with family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>  
        In conclusion, my best friend has taught me many valuable lessons about living life to the fullest.
         By embracing our passions, living in the present, and cherishing our relationships, we can all lead more fulfilling lives.
         I am grateful for her presence in my life, and I hope that her lessons can inspire others to live their lives to the fullest.</p>
