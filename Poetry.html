                <p class="card-text"> 

                  April is the cruellest month, breeding
                  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
                  Memory and desire, stirring
                  Dull roots with spring rain.
                  Winter kept us warm, covering
                  Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
                  A little life with dried tubers.
                  
                  Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
                  With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
                  And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
                  And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
                  
                  Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
                  And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,
                  My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,
                  And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
                  Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
                  
                  In the mountains, there you feel free.
                  
                  I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. <br> ~"The Waste Land" by T.S. Eliot</p>

              <p class="card-text">She walks in beauty, like the night
                Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
                And all that's best of dark and bright
                Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
                Thus mellowed to that tender light
                Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
                
                One shade the more, one ray the less,
                Had half impaired the nameless grace
                Which waves in every raven tress,
                Or softly lightens o'er her face;
                Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
                How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
                
                And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
                So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
                The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                But tell of days in goodness spent,
                A mind at peace with all below,
                A heart whose love is innocent! <br>~by Lord Byron</p>

            <p class="card-text">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
              And sorry I could not travel both
              And be one traveler, long I stood
              And looked down one as far as I could
              To where it bent in the undergrowth;
              
              Then took the other, as just as fair,
              And having perhaps the better claim,
              Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
              Though as for that the passing there
              Had worn them really about the same,
              
              And both that morning equally lay
              In leaves no step had trodden black.
              Oh, I kept the first for another day!
              Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
              I doubted if I should ever come back.
              
              I shall be telling this with a sigh
              Somewhere ages and ages hence:
              Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
              I took the one less traveled by,
              And that has made all the difference. <br>~Robert Frost</p>

                <p class="card-text">When the darkness and light meet,
                  The world is a canvas, blank and neat.
                  The shadows and highlights dance and play,
                  And the colors of life come out to sway.
                  
                  The darkness brings a cloak of mystery,
                  A shroud of secrets and history.
                  It wraps the world in its embrace,
                  And whispers secrets in every place.
                  
                  The light brings a warm and gentle glow,
                  A radiance that makes the world glow.
                  It shines on everything in sight,
                  And turns the darkness into bright.
                  
                  Together, they create a tapestry,
                  A weave of beauty and harmony.
                  The darkness and light, hand in hand,
                  Bring balance to this wondrous land.
                  
                  So embrace the darkness and light,
                  And let them paint your life so bright.
                  For when they meet, a masterpiece is born,
                  A painting of life, never to be torn.</p>

                I try to hold,
                Hold on to the memories,
                The smiles and laughs of others.
                When life takes me down,
                I look at their photos,
                Their messages and songs they sent me jokingly,
                When life takes me down,
                I sleep through all of it,
                Watch funny movies and take it all in,
                When life takes me down,
                I sit behind my brother watching him code,
                Show him mine,
                When life takes me down,
                I wrap myself in my blanket,
                Feel all my loved ones hugging me as I cry and let it out.
                When life takes me down,
                I try to reach out, But sometimes I want someone,
                To reach out themselves and as they hug me tight,
                Ask, Do I need something,
                Or how am I feeling now?

            <p class="card-text">Memories flood back, like a tidal wave
              From a past that I thought was safely stowed away
              I denied it, tried to forget it was mine
              But now it's back, a stark reminder of my life's design
              
              I thought I had buried it deep
              The secrets I didn't want to keep
              The mistakes I made, the things I did
              But they came back, as if to say "you can't get rid from me"
              
              It's hard to face the truth sometimes
              To acknowledge the past, the choices, the crimes
              To admit to oneself, that you weren't always right
              That sometimes you gave in to the darkness, and lost sight
              
              But it's also liberating in a way
              To confront the past, to face the fray
              To own up to the mistakes that you made
              To learn from them, and grow beyond their shade
              
              So I embrace the memories, the pain, and the strife
              I accept them as part of my journey, part of my life
              For they have shaped me, made me who I am today
              And I'm ready to face them, to put the past at bay.
